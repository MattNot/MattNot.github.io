This website will be my personal laboratory.

In Italy we say "**to shoot a fly with a cannon**" and that is exactly what I will do. I will try to apply DevOps techniques, microfrontend and maybe even a bit of blogging.

For those wondering, this site is built with 11ty, hosted on netlify. For now, there is no front-end framework. The theme is temporary and it's the [eleventy-chirpy-blog-template](https://github.com/muenzpraeger/eleventy-chirpy-blog-template)

For the microfrontend part, the idea is to integrate `Vue, React and Svelte`.
